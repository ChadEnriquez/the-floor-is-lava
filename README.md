# The Floor is Lava
This is a 2D Java Game that allows multiplayer mode. The game revolves around the concept of “The Floor is Lava”. There is a platform consisting of normal tiles and lava tiles/pits. This platform may also shrink by generating lava pits at the edges/boundaries of the platform itself. Upon playing the game, 4 players are spawned on the platform. The players can push another player into a lava pit, making the other player take damage and lose a life. These players have 3 lives. They will continue to respawn at set intervals if they still have lives. However, upon depleting your health pool, you are considered out and done for the game.
